        <h3>Apartheid history</h3>
        Apartheid was a system of institutionalized racial segregation and discrimination that took place in South Africa from 1948 to the early 1990s. The word "apartheid" is Afrikaans for "apartness," and it reflected the government's policy of separating different racial and ethnic groups in the country. Here's an overview of the history of apartheid in South Africa: <br>

       <h5>Key Events and Phases:</h5> 
        National Party's Rise to Power (1948):<br>
        <img src="1948.png" alt="300%" width="150px" height="150px">
        <p> National Party, led by Dr. Daniel François Malan, won the general elections in 1948, 
        and this marked the beginning of the official implementation of apartheid policies.</p>
       <h3> Apartheid Legislation:</h3>
        The government began enacting a series of laws that institutionalized racial segregation. These laws included the Population Registration Act, Group Areas Act, and the Suppression of Communism Act. <br>
         <h3>Homelands Policy:</h3>
        <img src="homeland.png" alt="300%" width="150px" height="150px"> <br>
        One of the central tenets of apartheid was the creation of separate "homelands" or "Bantustans" for different racial groups. These were designated areas where each racial group was supposed to live. <br>
        <h3>Pass Laws:</h3>
        <img src="pass-law.png" alt="300%" width="150px" height="150px"> <br>
        Pass laws were enacted to restrict the movement of black South Africans. They were required to carry passes that specified where they were allowed to live and work. Violating these laws often resulted in arrest and imprisonment. <br>
       <h3> Resistance and Protests:</h3>
        <img src="protest-meeting.png" alt="300%" width="150px" height="150px"><br>
        The apartheid policies were met with resistance from various quarters. Organizations like the African National Congress (ANC), Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), and others emerged to challenge the system. The Sharpeville Massacre in 1960, where police killed peaceful protesters, drew international attention. <br>
        <h3>Rivonia Trial (1964):</h3>
        <img src="trial-court.png" alt="300%" width="150px" height="150px"> <br>
        Leaders of the anti-apartheid movement, including Nelson Mandela, were arrested and charged with sabotage. Mandela and several others were sentenced to life imprisonment during the famous Rivonia Trial.
        International Isolation:
        
        As awareness of apartheid grew globally, there was increasing condemnation and calls for sanctions against South Africa. Many countries and organizations implemented economic and cultural boycotts.
        End of Apartheid (1990-1994):
        
        In 1990, President F.W. de Klerk announced the end of apartheid and the beginning of negotiations to establish a non-racial democratic system. Nelson Mandela was released from prison, and the ANC was unbanned. Multi-racial elections were held in 1994, leading to Mandela becoming the first black president of South Africa.
       <h3>Legacy:</h3>
       <img src="legacy.png" alt="">
        The legacy of apartheid still influences South Africa today. Efforts have been made to address the social, economic, and political imbalances created by decades of racial discrimination.
        The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was established to deal with the crimes committed during the apartheid era and promote national healing.
        South Africa's post-apartheid constitution is known for its commitment to human rights and equality.
        Despite the progress made since the end of apartheid, challenges such as economic inequality and social divisions persist, and the country continues to work towards building a more inclusive and just society.
