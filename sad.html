        Tel Aviv was founded in 1909 and developed as a metropolitan city under the British Mandate in Palestine. 
        The White City was constructed from the early 1930s until the 1950s, based on the urban plan by Sir Patrick Geddes, reflecting modern organic planning principles.
        Tel-Aviv port was one of the outcomes of the Big Arab Revolt in 1936-1939.
         As Jaffa's main port was shut down, the British authorized the Jews of Tel-Aviv to build a new port, next to Hayarkon steam. 
         By May 1936 the port had a functioning wharf, and the port was completed by 1938.<br><br>

        During its long history, Jerusalem has been attacked 52 times, captured and recaptured 44 times, besieged 23 times, and destroyed twice.[1] The oldest part of the city was settled in the 4th millennium BCE,
         making Jerusalem one of the oldest cities in the world.[2]
        Given the city's central position in both Israeli nationalism and Palestinian nationalism, the selectivity required to summarize more than 5,000 years of inhabited history is often influenced by ideological bias or background (see "Historiography and nationalism")
        .[3] For example, the Jewish periods of the city's history are important to Israeli nationalists, whose discourse states that modern Jews originate and descend from the Israelites
        ,[Note 1][Note 2] while the Islamic periods of the city's history are important to Palestinian nationalists, whose discourse suggests that modern Palestinians descend from all the different peoples who have lived in the region.
        [Note 3][Note 4] As a result, both sides claim the history of the city has been politicized by the other in order to strengthen their relative claims to the city,[3][8][9] and that this is borne out by the different focuses the different writers place on the various events and eras in the city's history.<br><br>
